# Nodejs-RESTAPI

Setup

1- To install node.js use the following command: $ sudo apt install Node.js

The 'npm install' command should add all the dependencies and devDependencies automatically during installation.

Once installed, verify it by checking the installed version using the following command: $ node -v or node –version

2- It is recommended to install Node Package Manager(NPM) with Node.js. NPM is an open source library of Node.js packages. To install NPM, use the following commands: $ sudo apt install npm

You can verify it is installed running the following command: $ npm -v or npm –version

To create the database I used MongoDB Atlas URL Endpoint: https://data.mongodb-api.com/app/data-uuzhr/endpoint/data/v1
